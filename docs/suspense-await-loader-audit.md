# Suspense & Await Loader Audit

## Overview
- Reviewed every `loader` and `clientLoader` under `apps/cyberstorm-remix` with a focus on Remix Suspense/Await integration.
- Goal: loaders should continue to return resolved data for SSR when possible, while client loaders should hand back the original promises so UI-level `Suspense` components can present fallbacks during client transitions.
- Server loaders continue to provide SSR-friendly resolved data so markup remains deterministic during the initial render.
- Refactored client loaders now return their original promises, letting Suspense fallbacks surface loading states and consolidate error handling in the UI.

## Additional notes
- All audited client loaders now return raw promises and delegate loading and error UI to Suspense `Await` wrappers (confirmed Oct 30 2025).
- Server loaders remain fully awaited so SSR output stays predictable while clients stream data.
- Shared error helpers (`handleLoaderError`, `resolveRouteErrorPayload`, `throwUserFacingPayloadResponse`) back the alert boundaries across the audited routes.
- Team settings layout and nested tabs share the Suspense skeleton and alert pattern introduced during this pass (updated Oct 30 2025).
- Future audits should document any routes that need both resolved SSR data and streamed client promises to keep contracts clear for downstream components.
